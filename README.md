## Architecture

1. **Embedding & Indexing**

   * Embedded legal documents and FAQs using Hugging Face embedding models.
   * Built a FAISS index for vector similarity search.
2. **Retriever**

   * Created a retriever object to fetch top-k relevant passages based on user queries.
3. **Prompt Template**

   * Defined templated prompts to provide context to the LLMs before generating responses.
4. **LLM Pipeline**

   * Integrated two backend models:

     * Google GeminiÂ 2.0 Flash
     * OpenAI GPT-4o Mini
   * Users can select their preferred model at runtime.
5. **Backend Server**

   * Python-based API server handling chat sessions, retrieval, and model calls.
6. **Frontend UI**

   * Streamlit app for chat interface, model selection, and conversation history.

  * Bare Acts: BNS, BNSS, BSA
  * Indian Penal Code (IPC)
  * Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC)
  * Information Technology Act (IEA)

python server.py
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:8000` by default.

### Start Streamlit Frontend

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Open your browser to `http://localhost:8501` to interact with iLegalBot.

## Customization

* **Adding New Documents**:

  1. Place new `.txt` or `.pdf` files into the `data/` directory.
  2. Run the indexing script:

     ```bash
     python scripts/build_index.py
     ```
* **Adjusting Prompt Templates**:

  * Edit `templates/chat_prompt.txt` to tweak the system instructions or conversation flow.
* **Switching Models**:

  * In the UI, use the model selector dropdown to switch between GeminiÂ 2.0 and GPT-4o Mini.

## Deployment

We recommend deploying the backend on a cloud VM (e.g., Google Compute Engine) and the Streamlit app via Streamlit Cloud or Docker.

### Docker (Optional)

1. Build the image:

   ```bash
   docker build -t ilegalbot .
   ```
2. Run the container:

   ```bash
   docker run -p 8000:8000 -p 8501:8501 --env-file .env ilegalbot
   ```
