(a) the sections in this sanhita, which contain definitions of offences, do not express that a child under seven years of age cannot commit such offences; but the definitions are to be understood subject to the general exception which provides that nothing shall be an offence which is done by a child under seven years of age. (b) a, a police officer, without warrant, apprehends z, who has committed murder. here a is not guilty of the offence of wrongful confinement; for he was bound by law to apprehend z, and therefore the case falls within the general exception which provides that nothing is an offence which is done by a person who is bound by law to do it. (2) every expression which is explained in any part of this sanhita, is used in every part of this sanhita in conformity with the explanation. (3) when property is in the possession of a persons spouse, clerk or servant, on account of that person, it is in that persons possession within the meaning of this sanhita. 18 explanation.a person employed temporarily or on a particular occasion in the capacity of a clerk or servant, is a clerk or servant within the meaning of this sub-section. (4) in every part of this sanhita, except where a contrary intention appears from the context, words which refer to acts done extend also to illegal omissions. (5) when a criminal act is done by several persons in furtherance of the common intention of all, each of such persons is liable for that act in the same manner as if it were done by him alone. (6) whenever an act, which is criminal only by reason of its being done with a criminal knowledge or intention, is done by several persons, each of such persons who joins in the act with such knowledge or intention is liable for the act in the same manner as if the act were done by him alone with that knowledge or intention. (7) wherever the causing of a certain effect, or an attempt to cause that effect, by an act or by an omission, is an offence, it is to be understood that the causing of that effect partly by an act and partly by an omission is the same offence. illustration. a intentionally causes zs death, partly by illegally omitting to give z food, and partly by beating z. a has committed murder. (8) when an offence is committed by means of several acts, whoever intentionally cooperates in the commission of that offence by doing any one of those acts, either singly or jointly with any other person, commits that offence. illustrations. (a) a and b agree to murder z by severally and at different times giving him small doses of poison. a and b administer the poison according to the agreement with intent to murder z. z dies from the effects the several doses of poison so administered to him. here a and b intentionally cooperate in the commission of murder and as each of them does an act by which the death is caused, they are both guilty of the offence though their acts are separate. (b) a and b are joint jailors, and as such have the charge of z, a prisoner, alternatively for six hours at a time. a and b, intending to cause zs death, knowingly cooperate in causing that effect by illegally omitting, each during the time of his attendance, to furnish z with food supplied to them for that purpose. z dies of hunger. both a and b are guilty of the murder of z. (c) a, a jailor, has the charge of z, a prisoner. a, intending to cause zs death, illegally omits to supply z with food; in consequence of which z is much reduced in strength, but the starvation is not sufficient to cause his death. a is dismissed from his office, and b succeeds him. b, without collusion or cooperation with a, illegally omits to supply z with food, knowing that he is likely thereby to cause zs death. z dies of hunger. b is guilty of murder, but, as a did not cooperate with b. a is guilty only of an attempt to commit murder. (9) where several persons are engaged or concerned in the commission of a criminal act, they may be guilty of different offences by means of that act. illustration. a attacks z under such circumstances of grave provocation that his killing of z would be only culpable homicide not amounting to murder. b, having ill-will towards z and intending to kill him, and not having been subject to the provocation, assists a in killing z. here, though a and b are both engaged in causing zs death, b is guilty of murder, and a is guilty only of culpable homicide. chapter ii of punishments 4. punishments. the punishments to which offenders are liable under the provisions of this sanhita are 19 (a) death; (b) imprisonment for life; (c) imprisonment, which is of two descriptions, namely: (1) rigorous, that is, with hard labour; (2) simple; (d) forfeiture of property; (e) fine; (f) community service. 5. commutation of sentence.the appropriate government may, without the consent of the offender, commute any punishment under this sanhita to any other punishment in accordance with section 474 of the bharatiya nagarik suraksha sanhita, 2023. explanation.for the purposes of this section the expression appropriate government means,  (a) in cases where the sentence is a sentence of death or is for an offence against any law relating to a matter to which the executive power of the union extends, the central government; and (b) in cases where the sentence (whether of death or not) is for an offence against any law relating to a matter to which the executive power of the state extends, the government of the state within which the offender is sentenced. 6. fractions of terms of punishment.in calculating fractions of terms of punishment, imprisonment for life shall be reckoned as equivalent to imprisonment for twenty years unless otherwise provided. 7. sentence may be (in certain cases of imprisonment) wholly or partly rigorous or simple.in every case in which an offender is punishable with imprisonment which may be of either description, it shall be competent to the court which sentences such offender to direct in the sentence that such imprisonment shall be wholly rigorous, or that such imprisonment shall be wholly simple, or that any part of such imprisonment shall be rigorous and the rest simple. 8. amount of fine, liability in default of payment of fine, etc.(1) where no sum is expressed to which a fine may extend, the amount of fine to which the offender is liable is unlimited, but shall not be excessive. (2) in every case of an offence (a) punishable with imprisonment as well as fine, in which the offender is sentenced to a fine, whether with or without imprisonment; (b) punishable with imprisonment or fine, or with fine only, in which the offender is sentenced to a fine, it shall be competent to the court which sentences such offender to direct by the sentence that, in default of payment of the fine, the offender shall suffer imprisonment for a certain term, in which imprisonment shall be in excess of any other imprisonment to which he may have been sentenced or to which he may be liable under a commutation of a sentence. (3) the term for which the court directs the offender to be imprisoned in default of payment of a fine shall not exceed one-fourth of the term of imprisonment which is the maximum fixed for the offence, if the offence be punishable with imprisonment as well as fine. (4) the imprisonment which the court imposes in default of payment of a fine or in default of community service may be of any description to which the offender might have been sentenced for the offence. (5) if the offence is punishable with fine or community service, the imprisonment which the court imposes in default of payment of the fine or in default of community service shall be simple, and the term for which the court directs the offender to be imprisoned, in default of payment of fine or in default of community service, shall not exceed, 20 (a) two months when the amount of the fine does not exceed five thousand rupees; (b) four months when the amount of the fine does not exceed ten thousand rupees; and (c) one year in any other case. (6) (a) the imprisonment which is imposed in default of payment of a fine shall terminate whenever that fine is either paid or levied by process of law; (b) if, before the expiration of the term of imprisonment fixed in default of payment, such a proportion of the fine be paid or levied that the term of imprisonment suffered in default of payment is not less than proportional to the part of the fine still unpaid, the imprisonment shall terminate. illustration. a is sentenced to a fine of one thousand rupees and to four months imprisonment in default of payment. here, if seven hundred and fifty rupees of the fine be paid or levied before the expiration of one month of the imprisonment, a will be discharged as soon as the first month has expired. if seven hundred and fifty rupees be paid or levied at the time of the expiration of the first month, or at any later time while a continues in imprisonment, a will be immediately discharged. if five hundred rupees of the fine be paid or levied before the expiration of two months of the imprisonment, a will be discharged as soon as the two months are completed. if five hundred rupees be paid or levied at the time of the expiration of those two months, or at any later time while a continues in imprisonment, a will be immediately discharged. (7) the fine, or any part thereof which remains unpaid, may be levied at any time within six years after the passing of the sentence, and if, under the sentence, the offender be liable to imprisonment for a longer period than six years, then at any time previous to the expiration of that period; and the death of the offender does not discharge from the liability any property which would, after his death, be legally liable for his debts. 9. limit of punishment of offence made up of several offences.(1) where anything which is an offence is made up of parts, any of which parts is itself an offence, the offender shall not be punished with the punishment of more than one of such his offences, unless it be so expressly provided. (2) where (a) anything is an offence falling within two or more separate definitions of any law in force for the time being by which offences are defined or punished; or (b) several acts, of which one or more than one would by itself or themselves constitute an offence, constitute, when combined, a different offence, the offender shall not be punished with a more severe punishment than the court which tries him could award for any one of such offences. illustrations. (a) a gives z fifty strokes with a stick. here a may have committed the offence of voluntarily causing hurt to z by the whole beating, and also by each of the blows which make up the whole beating. if a were liable to punishment for every blow, he might be imprisoned for fifty years, one for each blow. but he is liable only to one punishment for the whole beating. (b) but, if, while a is beating z, y interferes, and a intentionally strikes y, here, as the blow given to y is no part of the act whereby a voluntarily causes hurt to z, a is liable to one punishment for voluntarily causing hurt to z, and to another for the blow given to y. 10. punishment of person guilty of one of several offences, judgment stating that it is doubtful of which.in all cases in which judgment is given that a person is guilty of one of several offences specified in the judgment, but that it is doubtful of which of these offences he is guilty, the offender shall be punished for the offence for which the lowest punishment is provided if the same punishment is not provided for all. 21 11. solitary confinement.whenever any person is convicted of an offence for which under this sanhita the court has power to sentence him to rigorous imprisonment, the court may, by its sentence, order that the offender shall be kept in solitary confinement for any portion or portions of the imprisonment to which he is sentenced, not exceeding three months in the whole, according to the following scale, namely:  (a) a time not exceeding one month if the term of imprisonment shall not exceed six months; (b) a time not exceeding two months if the term of imprisonment shall exceed six months and shall not exceed one year; (c) a time not exceeding three months if the term of imprisonment shall exceed one year. 12. limit of solitary confinement.in executing a sentence of solitary confinement, such confinement shall in no case exceed fourteen days at a time, with intervals between the periods of solitary confinement of not less duration than such periods; and when the imprisonment awarded shall exceed three months, the solitary confinement shall not exceed seven days in any one month of the whole imprisonment awarded, with intervals between the periods of solitary confinement of not less duration than such periods. 13. enhanced punishment for certain offences after previous conviction.whoever, having been convicted by a court in india, of an offence punishable under chapter x or chapter xvii of this sanhita with imprisonment of either description for a term of three years or upwards, shall be guilty of any offence punishable under either of those chapters with like imprisonment for the like term, shall be subject for every such subsequent offence to imprisonment for life, or to imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years. chapter iii general exceptions 14. act done by a person bound, or by mistake of fact believing himself bound, by law. nothing is an offence which is done by a person who is, or who by reason of a mistake of fact and not by reason of a mistake of law in good faith believes himself to be, bound by law to do it. illustrations. (a) a, a soldier, fires on a mob by the order of his superior officer, in conformity with the commands of the law. a has committed no offence. (b) a, an officer of a court, being ordered by that court to arrest y, and, after due enquiry, believing z to be y, arrests z. a has committed no offence. 15. act of judge when acting judicially.nothing is an offence which is done by a judge when acting judicially in the exercise of any power which is, or which in good faith he believes to be, given to him by law. 16. act done pursuant to judgment or order of court.nothing which is done in pursuance of, or which is warranted by the judgment or order of, a court; if done whilst such judgment or order remains in force, is an offence, notwithstanding the court may have had no jurisdiction to pass such judgment or order, provided the person doing the act in good faith believes that the court had such jurisdiction. 17. act done by a person justified, or by mistake of fact believing himself justified, by law. nothing is an offence which is done by any person who is justified by law, or who by reason of a mistake of fact and not by reason of a mistake of law in good faith, believes himself to be justified by law, in doing it. 22 illustration. a sees z commit what appears to a to be a murder. a, in the exercise, to the best of his judgment exerted in good faith, of the power which the law gives to all persons of apprehending murderers in the fact, seizes z, in order to bring z before the proper authorities. a has committed no offence, though it may turn out that z was acting in self-defence. 18. accident in doing a lawful act.nothing is an offence which is done by accident or misfortune, and without any criminal intention or knowledge in the doing of a lawful act in a lawful manner by lawful means and with proper care and caution. illustration. a is at work with a hatchet; the head flies off and kills a man who is standing by. here, if there was no want of proper caution on the part of a, his act is excusable and not an offence. 19. act likely to cause harm, but done without criminal intent, and to prevent other harm. nothing is an offence merely by reason of its being done with the knowledge that it is likely to cause harm, if it be done without any criminal intention to cause harm, and in good faith for the purpose of preventing or avoiding other harm to person or property. explanation.it is a question of fact in such a case whether the harm to be prevented or avoided was of such a nature and so imminent as to justify or excuse the risk of doing the act with the knowledge that it was likely to cause harm. illustrations. (a) a, the captain of a vessel, suddenly and without any fault or negligence on his part, finds himself in such a position that, before he can stop his vessel, he must inevitably run down a boat b, with twenty or thirty passengers on board, unless he changes the course of his vessel, and that, by changing his course, he must incur risk of running down a boat c with only two passengers on board, which he may possibly clear. here, if a alters his course without any intention to run down the boat c and in good faith for the purpose of avoiding the danger to the passengers in the boat b, he is not guilty of an offence, though he may run down the boat c by doing an act which he knew was likely to cause that effect, if it be found as a matter of fact that the danger which he intended to avoid was such as to excuse him in incurring the risk of running down the boat c. (b) a, in a great fire, pulls down houses in order to prevent the conflagration from spreading. he does this with the intention in good faith of saving human life or property. here, if it be found that the harm to be prevented was of such a nature and so imminent as to excuse as act, a is not guilty of the offence. 20. act of a child under seven years of age.nothing is an offence which is done by a child under seven years of age. 21. act of a child above seven and under twelve years of age of immature understanding. nothing is an offence which is done by a child above seven years of age and under twelve years of age, who has not attained sufficient maturity of understanding to judge of the nature and consequences of his conduct on that occasion. 22. act of a person of unsound mind.nothing is an offence which is done by a person who, at the time of doing it, by reason of unsoundness of mind, is incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is either wrong or contrary to law. 23. act of a person incapable of judgment by reason of intoxication caused against his will. nothing is an offence which is done by a person who, at the time of doing it, is, by reason of intoxication, incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is either wrong, or contrary to law; provided that the thing which intoxicated him was administered to him without his knowledge or against his will. 24. offence requiring a particular intent or knowledge committed by one who is intoxicated. in cases where an act done is not an offence unless done with a particular knowledge or intent, a person who does the act in a state of intoxication shall be liable to be dealt with as if he had the same knowledge 23 as he would have had if he had not been intoxicated, unless the thing which intoxicated him was administered to him without his knowledge or against his will. 25. act not intended and not known to be likely to cause death or grievous hurt, done by consent.nothing which is not intended to cause death, or grievous hurt, and which is not known by the doer to be likely to cause death or grievous hurt, is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause, or be intended by the doer to cause, to any person, above eighteen years of age, who has given consent, whether express or implied, to suffer that harm; or by reason of any harm which it may be known by the doer to be likely to cause to any such person who has consented to take the risk of that harm. illustration. a and z agree to fence with each other for amusement. this agreement implies the consent of each to suffer any harm which, in the course of such fencing, may be caused without foul play; and if a, while playing fairly, hurts z, a commits no offence. 26. act not intended to cause death, done by consent in good faith for persons benefit. nothing, which is not intended to cause death, is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause, or be intended by the doer to cause, or be known by the doer to be likely to cause, to any person for whose benefit it is done in good faith, and who has given a consent, whether express or implied, to suffer that harm, or to take the risk of that harm. illustration. a, a surgeon, knowing that a particular operation is likely to cause the death of z, who suffers under the painful complaint, but not intending to cause zs death, and intending, in good faith, zs benefit, performs that operation on z, with zs consent. a has committed no offence. 27. act done in good faith for benefit of child or person of unsound mind, by, or by consent of guardian.nothing which is done in good faith for the benefit of a person under twelve years of age, or person of unsound mind, by, or by consent, either express or implied, of the guardian or other person having lawful charge of that person, is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause, or be intended by the doer to cause or be known by the doer to be likely to cause to that person: provided that this exception shall not extend to (a) the intentional causing of death, or to the attempting to cause death; (b) the doing of anything which the person doing it knows to be likely to cause death, for any purpose other than the preventing of death or grievous hurt, or the curing of any grievous disease or infirmity; (c) the voluntary causing of grievous hurt, or to the attempting to cause grievous hurt, unless it be for the purpose of preventing death or grievous hurt, or the curing of any grievous disease or infirmity; (d) the abetment of any offence, to the committing of which offence it would not extend. illustration. a, in good faith, for his childs benefit without his childs consent, has his child cut for the stone by a surgeon knowing it to be likely that the operation will cause the childs death, but not intending to cause the childs death. a is within the exception, in as much as his object was the cure of the child. 28. consent known to be given under fear or misconception.a consent is not such a consent as is intended by any section of this sanhita, (a) if the consent is given by a person under fear of injury, or under a misconception of fact, and if the person doing the act knows, or has reason to believe, that the consent was given in consequence of such fear or misconception; or (b) if the consent is given by a person who, from unsoundness of mind, or intoxication, is unable to understand the nature and consequence of that to which he gives his consent; or 24 (c) unless the contrary appears from the context, if the consent is given by a person who is under twelve years of age. 29. exclusion of acts which are offences independently of harm caused.the exceptions in sections 25, 26 and 27 do not extend to acts which are offences independently of any harm which they may cause, or be intended to cause, or be known to be likely to cause, to the person giving the consent, or on whose behalf the consent is given. illustration. causing miscarriage (unless caused in good faith for the purpose of saving the life of the woman) is an offence independently of any harm which it may cause or be intended to cause to the woman. therefore, it is not an offence by reason of such harm; and the consent of the woman or of her guardian to the causing of such miscarriage does not justify the act. 30. act done in good faith for benefit of a person without consent.nothing is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause to a person for whose benefit it is done in good faith, even without that persons consent, if the circumstances are such that it is impossible for that person to signify consent, or if that person is incapable of giving consent, and has no guardian or other person in lawful charge of him from whom it is possible to obtain consent in time for the thing to be done with benefit: provided that this exception shall not extend to (a) the intentional causing of death, or the attempting to cause death; (b) the doing of anything which the person doing it knows to be likely to cause death, for any purpose other than the preventing of death or grievous hurt, or the curing of any grievous disease or infirmity; (c) the voluntary causing of hurt, or to the attempting to cause hurt, for any purpose other than the preventing of death or hurt; (d) the abetment of any offence, to the committing of which offence it would not extend. illustrations. (1) z is thrown from his horse, and is insensible. a, a surgeon, finds that z requires to be trepanned. a, not intending zs death, but in good faith, for zs benefit, performs the trepan before z recovers his power of judging for himself. a has committed no offence. (2) z is carried off by a tiger. a fires at the tiger knowing it to be likely that the shot may kill z, but not intending to kill z, and in good faith intending zs benefit. as bullet gives z a mortal wound. a has committed no offence.
